Fellow citizens of the Senate and of the House of Representatives: If the enjoyment in profusion of the bounties of Providence forms a suitable subject of mutual gratulation and grateful acknowledgment we are admonished at this return of the season when the representatives of the nation are assembled to deliberate upon their concerns to offer up the tribute of fervent and grateful hearts for the never failing mercies of Him who ruleth over all. He has again favored us with healthful seasons and abundant harvests; He has sustained us in peace with foreign countries and in tranquillity within our borders; He has preserved us in the quiet and undisturbed possession of civil and religious liberty; He has crowned the year with His goodness imposing on us no other condition than of improving for our own happiness the blessings bestowed by His hands and in the fruition of all His favors of devoting his faculties with which we have been endowed by Him to His glory and to our own temporal and eternal welfare. In the relations of our federal union with our brethren of the human race the changes which have occurred since the close of your last session have generally tended to the preservation of peace and to the cultivation of harmony. Before your last separation a war had unhappily been kindled between the Empire of Russia one of those with which our intercourse has been no other than a constant exchange of good offices and that of the Ottoman Porte a nation from which geographical distance religious opinions and maxims of government on their part little suited to the formation of those bonds of mutual benevolence which result from the benefits of commerce had department us in a state perhaps too much prolonged of coldness and alienation. The extensive fertile and populous dominions of the Sultan belong rather to the Asiatic than the European division of the human family. They enter but partially into the system of Europe nor have their wars with Russia and Austria the European States upon which they border for more than a century past disturbed the pacific relations of those States with the other great powers of Europe. Neither France nor Prussia nor Great Britain has ever taken part in them nor is it to be expected that they will at this time. The declaration of war by Russia has received the approbation or acquiescence of her allies and we may indulge the hope that its progress and termination will be signalized by the moderation and forbearance no less than by the energy of the Emperor Nicholas and that it will afford the opportunity for such collateral agency in behalf of the suffering Greeks as will secure to them ultimately the triumph of humanity and of freedom. The state of our particular relations with France has scarcely varied in the course of the present year. The commercial intercourse between the two countries has continued to increase for the mutual benefit of both. The claims of indemnity to numbers of our fellow citizens for depredations upon their property heretofore committed during the revolutionary governments remain unadjusted and still form the subject of earnest representation and remonstrance. Recent advices from the minister of the United States at Paris encourage the expectation that the appeal to the justice of the French government will ere long receive a favorable consideration. The last friendly expedient has been resorted to for the decision of the controversy with Great Britain relating to the northeastern boundary of the United States. By an agreement with the British government carrying into effect the provisions of the fifth article of the Treaty of Ghent and the convention of 1827-09-29 His Majesty the King of the Netherlands has by common consent been selected as the umpire between the parties. The proposal to him to accept the designation for the performance of this friendly office will be made at an early day and the United States relying upon the justice of their cause will cheerfully commit the arbitrament of it to a prince equally distinguished for the independence of his spirit his indefatigable assiduity to the duties of his station and his inflexible personal probity. Our commercial relations with Great Britain will deserve the serious consideration of Congress and the exercise of a conciliatory and forbearing spirit in the policy of both governments. The state of them has been materially changed by the act of Congress passed at their last session in alteration of several acts imposing duties on imports and by acts of more recent date of the British Parliament. The effect of the interdiction of direct trade commenced by Great Britain and reciprocated by the United States has been as was to be foreseen only to substitute different channels for an exchange of commodities indispensable to the colonies and profitable to a numerous class of our fellow citizens. The exports the revenue the navigation of the United States have suffered no diminution by our exclusion from direct access to the British colonies. The colonies pay more dearly for the necessaries of life which their government burdens with the charges of double voyages freight insurance and commission and the profits of our exports are somewhat impaired and more injuriously transferred from one portion of our citizens to another. The resumption of this old and otherwise exploded system of colonial exclusion has not secured to the shipping interest of Great Britain the relief which at the expense of the distant colonies and of the United States it was expected to afford. Other measures have been resorted to more pointedly bearing upon the navigation of the United States and more pointedly bearing upon the navigation of the United States and which unless modified by the construction given to the recent acts of Parliament will be manifestly incompatible with the positive stipulations of the commercial convention existing between the two countries. That convention however may be terminated with 12 months' notice at the option of either party. A treaty of amity navigation and commerce between the United States and His Majesty the Emperor of Austria King of Hungary and Bohemia has been prepared for signature by the Secretary of State and by the Baron de Lederer intrusted with full powers of the Austrian government. Independently of the new and friendly relations which may be thus commenced with one of the most eminent and powerful nations of the earth the occasion has been taken in it as in other recent treaties concluded by the United States to extend those principles of liberal intercourse and of fair reciprocity which intertwine with the exchanges of commerce the principles of justice and the feelings of mutual benevolence. This system first proclaimed to the world in the first commercial treaty ever concluded by the United States—that of 1778-02-06 with France—has been invariably the cherished policy of our Union. It is by treaties of commerce alone that it can be made ultimately to prevail as the established system of all civilized nations. With this principle our fathers extended the hand of friendship to every nation of the globe and to this policy our country has ever since adhered. What ever of regulation in our laws has ever been adopted unfavorable to the interest of any foreign nation has been essentially defensive and counteracting to similar regulations of theirs operating against us. Immediately after the close of the War of Independence commissioners were appointed by the Congress of the Confederation authorized to conclude treaties with every nation of Europe disposed to adopt them. Before the wars of the French Revolution such treaties had been consummated with the United Netherlands Sweden and Prussia. During those wars treaties with Great Britain and Spain had been effected and those with Prussia and France renewed. In all these some concessions to the liberal principles of intercourse proposed by the United States had been obtained; but as in all the negotiations they came occasionally in collision with previous internal regulations or exclusive and excluding compacts of monopoly with which the other parties had been trammeled the advances made in them toward the freedom of trade were partial and imperfect. Colonial establishments chartered companies and ship building influence pervaded and encumbered the legislation of all the great commercial states; and the United States in offering free trade and equal privilege to all were compelled to acquiesce in many exceptions with each of the parties to their treaties accommodated to their existing laws and anterior agreements. The colonial system by which this whole hemisphere was bound has fallen into ruins totally abolished by revolutions converting colonies into independent nations throughout the two American continents excepting a portion of territory chiefly at the northern extremity of our own and confined to the remnants of dominion retained by Great Britain over the insular archipelago geographically the appendages of our part of the globe. With all the rest we have free trade even with the insular colonies of all the European nations except Great Britain. Her government also had manifested approaches to the adoption of a free and liberal intercourse between her colonies and other nations though by a sudden and scarcely explained revulsion the spirit of exclusion has been revived for operation upon the United States alone. The conclusion of our last treaty of peace with Great Britain was shortly afterwards followed by a commercial convention placing the direct intercourse between the two countries upon a footing of more equal reciprocity than had ever before been admitted. The same principle has since been much further extended by treaties with France Sweden Denmark the Hanseatic cities Prussia in Europe and with the Republics of Colombia and of Central America in this hemisphere. The mutual abolition of discriminating duties and charges upon the navigation and commercial intercourse between the parties is the general maxim which characterizes them all. There is reason to expect that it will at no distant period be adopted by other nations both of Europe and America and to hope that by its universal prevalence one of the fruitful sources of wars of commercial competition will be extinguished. Among the nations upon whose governments many of our fellow citizens have had long-pending claims of indemnity for depredations upon their property during a period when the rights of neutral commerce were disregarded was that of Denmark. They were soon after the events occurred the subject of a special mission from the United States at the close of which the assurance was given by His Danish Majesty that at a period of more tranquillity and of less distress they would be considered examined and decided upon in a spirit of determined purpose for the dispensation of justice. I have much pleasure in informing Congress that the fulfillment of this honorable promise is now in progress; that a small portion of the claims has already been settled to the satisfaction of the claimants and that we have reason to hope that the remainder will shortly be placed in a train of equitable adjustment. This result has always been confidently expected from the character of personal integrity and of benevolence which the Sovereign of the Danish dominions has through every vicissitude of fortune maintained. The general aspect of the affairs of our neighboring American nations of the south has been rather of approaching than of settled tranquillity. Internal disturbances have been more frequent among them than their common friends would have desired. Our intercourse with all has continued to be that of friendship and of mutual good will. Treaties of commerce and of boundaries with the United Mexican States have been negotiated but from various successive obstacles not yet brought to a final conclusion. The civil war which unfortunately still prevails in the republics of Central America has been unpropitious to the cultivation of our commercial relations with them; and the dissensions and revolutionary changes in the republics of Colombia and of Peru have been seen with cordial regret by us who would gladly contribute to the happiness of both. It is with great satisfaction however that we have witnessed the recent conclusion of a peace between the governments of Buenos Aires and of Brazil and it is equally gratifying to observe that indemnity has been obtained for some of the injuries which our fellow citizens had sustained in the latter of those countries. The rest are in a train of negotiation which we hope may terminate to mutual satisfaction and that it may be succeeded by a treaty of commerce and navigation upon liberal principles propitious to a great and growing commerce already important to the interests of our country. The condition and prospects of the revenue are more favorable than our most sanguine expectations had anticipated. The balance in the Treasury on 1828-01-01 exclusive of the moneys received under the convention of 1826-11-13 with Great Britain was $5861972.83. The receipts into the Treasury from 1828-01-01 to 1828-09-30 so far as they have been ascertained to form the basis of an estimate amount to $18633580.27 which with the receipts of the present quarter estimated at $5461283.40 form an aggregate of receipts during the year of $24094863.67. The expenditures of the year may probably amount to $25637111.63 and leave in the Treasury on 1829-01-01 the sum of $5125638.14. The receipts of the present year have amounted to near $2000000 more than was anticipated at the commencement of the last session of Congress. The amount of duties secured on importations from the first of January to the 30th of September was about $22997000 and that of the estimated accruing revenue is $5000000 forming an aggregate for the year of near $28000000. This is $1000000 more than the estimate last December for the accruing revenue of the present year which with allowances for draw-backs and contingent deficiencies was expected to produce an actual revenue of $22300000. Had these only been realized the expenditures of the year would have been also proportionally reduced for of these $24000000 received upward of $9000000 have been applied to the extinction of public debt bearing an interest of 6 percent a year and of course reducing the burden of interest annually payable in future by the amount of more than $500000. The payments on account of interest during the current year exceed $3000000 presenting an aggregate of more than $12000000 applied during the year to the discharge of the public debt the whole of which remaining due on 1829-01-01 will amount only to $58362135.78. That the revenue of the ensuing year will not fall short of that received in the one now expiring there are indications which can scarcely prove deceptive. In our country an uniform experience of 40 years has shown that what ever the tariff of duties upon articles imported from abroad has been the amount of importations has always borne an average value nearly approaching to that of the exports though occasionally differing in the balance some times being more and some times less. It is indeed a general law of prosperous commerce that the real value of exports should by a small and only a small balance exceed that of imports that balance being a permanent addition to the wealth of the nation. The extent of the prosperous commerce of the nation must be regulated by the amount of its exports and an important addition to the value of these will draw after it a corresponding increase of importations. It has happened in the vicissitudes of the seasons that the harvests of all Europe have in the late summer and autumn fallen short of their usual average. A relaxation of the interdict upon the importation of grain and flour from abroad has ensued a propitious market has been opened to the granaries of our country and a new prospect of reward presented to the labors of the husband-man which for several years has been denied. This accession to the profits of agriculture in the middle and western portions of our union is accidental and temporary. It may continue only for a single year. It may be as has been often experienced in the revolutions of time but the first of several scanty harvests in succession. We may consider it certain that for the approaching year it has added an item of large amount to the value of our exports and that it will produce a corresponding increase of importations. It may therefore confidently be foreseen that the revenue of 1829 will equal and probably exceed that of 1828 and will afford the means of extinguishing $10000000 more of the principal of the public debt. This new element of prosperity to that part of our agricultural industry which is occupied in producing the first article of human subsistence is of the most cheering character to the feelings of patriotism. Proceeding from a cause which humanity will view with concern the sufferings of scarcity in distant lands it yields a consolatory reflection that this scarcity is in no respect attributable to us; that it comes from the dispensation of Him who ordains all in wisdom and goodness and who permits evil itself only as an instrument of good; that far from contributing to this scarcity our agency will be applied only to the alleviation of its severity and that in pouring forth from the abundance of our own garners the supplies which will partially restore plenty to those who are in need we shall ourselves reduce our stores and add to the price of our own bread so as in some degree to participate in the wants which it will be the good fortune of our country to relieve. The great interests of an agricultural commercial and manufacturing nation are so linked in union together that no permanent cause of prosperity to one of them can operate without extending its influence to the others. All these interests are alike under the protecting power of the legislative authority and the duties of the representative bodies are to conciliate them in harmony together. So far as the object of taxation is to raise a revenue for discharging the debts and defraying the expenses of the community its operation should be adapted as much as possible to suit the burden with equal hand upon all in proportion with their ability of bearing it without oppression. But the legislation of one nation is some times intentionally made to bear heavily upon the interests of another. That legislation adapted as it is meant to be to the special interests of its own people will often press most unequally upon the several component interests of its neighbors. Thus the legislation of Great Britain when as has recently been avowed adapted to the depression of a rival nation will naturally abound with regulations to interdict upon the productions of the soil or industry of the other which come in competition with its own and will present encouragement perhaps even bounty to the raw material of the other state which it can not produce itself and which is essential for the use of its manufactures competitors in the markets of the world with those of its commercial rival. Such is the state of commercial legislation of Great Britain as it bears upon our interests. It excludes with interdicting duties all importation (except in time of approaching famine) of the great staple of production of our Middle and Western states; it proscribes with equal rigor the bulkier lumber and live stock of the same portion and also of the Northern and Eastern part of our Union. It refuses even the rice of the South unless aggravated with a charge of duty upon the Northern carrier who brings it to them. But the cotton indispensable for their looms they will receive almost duty free to weave it into a fabric for our own wear to the destruction of our own manufactures which they are enabled thus to under-sell. Is the self-protecting energy of this nation so helpless that there exists in the political institutions of our country no power to counteract the bias of this foreign legislation; that the growers of grain must submit to this exclusion from the foreign markets of their produce; that the shippers must dismantle their ships the trade of the North stagnate at the wharves and the manufacturers starve at their looms while the whole people shall pay tribute to foreign industry to be clad in a foreign garb; that the Congress of the Union are impotent to restore the balance in favor of native industry destroyed by the statutes of another realm? More just and generous sentiments will I trust prevail. If the tariff adopted at the last session of Congress shall be found by experience to bear oppressively upon the interests of any one section of the union it ought to be and I can not doubt will be so modified as to alleviate its burden. To the voice of just complaint from any portion of their constituents the representatives of the states and of the people will never turn away their ears. But so long as the duty of the foreign shall operate only as a bounty upon the domestic article; while the planter and the merchant and the shepherd and the husbandman shall be found thriving in their occupations under the duties imposed for the protection of domestic manufactures they will not repine at the prosperity shared with themselves by their fellow citizens of other professions nor denounce as violations of the Constitution the deliberate acts of Congress to shield from the wrongs of foreigns the native industry of the union. While the tariff of the last session of Congress was a subject of legislative deliberation it was foretold by some of its opposers that one of its necessary consequences would be to impair the revenue. It is yet too soon to pronounce with confidence that this prediction was erroneous. The obstruction of one avenue of trade not unfrequently opens an issue to another. The consequence of the tariff will be to increase the exportation and to diminish the importation of some specific articles; but by the general law of trade the increase of exportation of one article will be followed by an increased importation of others the duties upon which will supply the deficiencies which the diminished importation would otherwise occasion. The effect of taxation upon revenue can seldom be foreseen with certainty. It must abide the test of experience. As yet no symptoms of diminution are perceptible in the receipts of the Treasury. As yet little addition of cost has even been experienced upon the articles burdened with heavier duties by the last tariff. The domestic manufacturer supplies the same or a kindred article at a diminished price and the consumer pays the same tribute to the labor of his own country-man which he must otherwise have paid to foreign industry and toil. The tariff of the last session was in its details not acceptable to the great interests of any portion of the union not even to the interest which it was specially intended to subserve. Its object was to balance the burdens upon native industry imposed by the operation of foreign laws but not to aggravate the burdens of one section of the union by the relief afforded to another. To the great principle sanctioned by that act—one of those upon which the Constitution itself was formed—I hope and trust the authorities of the union will adhere. But if any of the duties imposed by the act only relieve the manufacturer by aggravating the burden of the planter let a careful revisal of its provisions enlightened by the practical experience of its effects be directed to retain those which impart protection to native industry and remove or supply the place of those which only alleviate one great national interest by the depression of another. The United States of America and the people of every state of which they are composed are each of them sovereign powers. The legislative authority of the whole is exercised by Congress under authority granted them in the common Constitution. The legislative power of each state is exercised by assemblies deriving their authority from the constitution of the state. Each is sovereign within its own province. The distribution of power between them presupposes that these authorities will move in harmony with each other. The members of the state and general governments are all under oath to support both and allegiance is due to the one and to the other. The case of a conflict between these two powers has not been supposed nor has any provision been made for it in our institutions; as a virtuous nation of ancient times existed more than five centuries without a law for the punishment of parricide. More than once however in the progress of our history have the people and the legislatures of one or more states in moments of excitement been instigated to this conflict; and the means of effecting this impulse have been allegations that the acts of Congress to be resisted were unconstitutional. The people of no one state have ever delegated to their legislature the power of pronouncing an act of Congress unconstitutional but they have delegated to them powers by the exercise of which the execution of the laws of Congress within the state may be resisted. If we suppose the case of such conflicting legislation sustained by the corresponding executive and judicial authorities patriotism and philanthropy turn their eyes from the condition in which the parties would be placed and from that of the people of both which must be its victims. The reports from the Secretary of War and the various subordinate offices of the resort of that department present an exposition of the public administration of affairs connected with them through the course of the current year. The present state of the Army and the distribution of the force of which it is composed will be seen from the report of the Major General. Several alterations in the disposal of the troops have been found expedient in the course of the year and the discipline of the Army though not entirely free from exception has been generally good. The attention of Congress is particularly invited to that part of the report of the Secretary of War which concerns the existing system of our relations with the Indian tribes. At the establishment of the federal government under the present Constitution of the United States the principle was adopted of considering them as foreign and independent powers and also as proprietors of lands. They were moreover considered as savages whom it was our policy and our duty to use our influence in converting to Christianity and in bringing within the pale of civilization. As independent powers we negotiated with them by treaties; as proprietors we purchased of them all the lands which we could prevail upon them to sell; as brethren of the human race rude and ignorant we endeavored to bring them to the knowledge of religion and letters. The ultimate design was to incorporate in our own institutions that portion of them which could be converted to the state of civilization. In the practice of European states before our Revolution they had been considered as children to be governed; as tenants at discretion to be dispossessed as occasion might require; as hunters to be indemnified by trifling concessions for removal from the grounds from which their game was extirpated. In changing the system it would seem as if a full contemplation of the consequences of the change had not been taken. We have been far more successful in the acquisition of their lands than in imparting to them the principles or inspiring them with the spirit of civilization. But in appropriating to ourselves their hunting grounds we have brought upon ourselves the obligation of providing them with subsistence; and when we have had the rare good fortune of teaching them the arts of civilization and the doctrines of Christianity we have unexpectedly found them forming in the midst of ourselves communities claiming to be independent of ours and rivals of sovereignty within the territories of the members of our Union. This state of things requires that a remedy should be provided—a remedy which while it shall do justice to those unfortunate children of nature may secure to the members of our confederation their rights of sovereignty and of soil. As the outline of a project to that effect the views presented in the report of the Secretary of War are recommended to the consideration of Congress. The report from the Engineer Department presents a comprehensive view of the progress which has been made in the great systems promotive of the public interest commenced and organized under authority of Congress and the effects of which have already contributed to the security as they will hereafter largely contribute to the honor and dignity of the nation. The first of these great systems is that of fortifications commenced immediately after the close of our last war under the salutary experience which the events of that war had impressed upon our country-men of its necessity. Introduced under the auspices of my immediate predecessor it has been continued with the persevering and liberal encouragement of the legislature and combined with corresponding exertions for the gradual increase and improvement of the Navy prepares for our extensive country a condition of defense adapted to any critical emergency which the varying course of events may bring forth. Our advances in these concerted systems have for the last 10 years been steady and progressive and in a few years more will be so completed as to leave no cause for apprehension that our sea coast will ever again offer a theater of hostile invasion. The next of these cardinal measures of policy is the preliminary to great and lasting works of public improvement in the surveys of roads examination for the course of canals and labors for the removal of the obstructions of rivers and harbors first commenced by the act of Congress of 1824-04-30. The report exhibits in one table the funds appropriated at the last and preceding sessions of Congress for all these fortifications surveys and works of public improvement the manner in which these funds have been applied the amount expended upon the several works under construction and the further sums which may be necessary to complete them; in a second the works projected by the Board of Engineers which have not been commenced and the estimate of their cost; in a third the report of the annual Board of Visitors at the Military Academy at West Point. For 13 fortifications erecting on various points of our Atlantic coast from Rhode Island to Louisiana the aggregate expenditure of the year has fallen little short of $1000000. For the preparation of five additional reports of reconnoissances and surveys since the last session of Congress for the civil construction upon 37 different public works commenced eight others for which specific appropriations have been made by acts of Congress and 20 other incipient surveys under the authority given by the act of 1824-04-30 about $1000000 more has been drawn from the Treasury. To these $2000000 is to be added the appropriation of $250000 to commence the erection of a break-water near the mouth of the Delaware River the subscriptions to the Delaware and Chesapeake the Louisville and Portland the Dismal Swamp and the Chesapeake and Ohio canals the large donations of lands to the States of Ohio Indiana Illinois and Alabama for objects of improvements within those States and the sums appropriated for light-houses buoys and piers on the coast; and a full view will be taken of the munificence of the nation in the application of its resources to the improvement of its own condition. Of these great national undertakings the Academy at West Point is among the most important in itself and the most comprehensive in its consequences. In that institution a part of the revenue of the nation is applied to defray the expense of educating a competent portion of her youth chiefly to the knowledge and the duties of military life. It is the living armory of the nation. While the other works of improvement enumerated in the reports now presented to the attention of Congress are destined to ameliorate the face of nature to multiply the facilities of communication between the different parts of the Union to assist the labors increase the comforts and enhance the enjoyments of individuals the instruction acquired at West Point enlarges the dominion and expands the capacities of the mind. Its beneficial results are already experienced in the composition of the Army and their influence is felt in the intellectual progre
