To the Senate and House of Representatives: In submitting my annual message to Congress I have great satisfaction in being able to say that the general conditions affecting the commercial and industrial interests of the United States are in the highest degree favorable. A comparison of the existing conditions with those of the most favored period in the history of the country will I believe show that so high a degree of prosperity and so general a diffusion of the comforts of life were never before enjoyed by our people. The total wealth of the country in 1860 was $16159616068. In 1890 it amounted to $62610000000 an increase of 287 per cent. The total mileage of railways in the United States in 1860 was 30626. In 1890 it was 167741 an increase of 448 per cent; and it is estimated that there will be about 4000 miles of track added by the close of the year 1892. The official returns of the Eleventh Census and those of the Tenth Census for seventy-five leading cities furnish the basis for the following comparisons: In 1880 the capital invested in manufacturing was $1232839670. In 1890 the capital invested in manufacturing was $2900735884. In 1880 the number of employees was 1301388. In 1890 the number of employees was 2251134. In 1880 the wages earned were $501965778. In 1890 the wages earned were $1221170454. In 1880 the value of the product was $2711579899. In 1890 the value of the product was $4860286837. I am informed by the Superintendent of the Census that the omission of certain industries in 1880 which were included in 1890 accounts in part for the remarkable increase thus shown but after making full allowance for differences of method and deducting the returns for all industries not included in the census of 1880 there remain in the reports from these seventy-five cities an increase in the capital employed of $1522745604 in the value of the product of $2024236166 in wages earned of $677943929 and in the number of wage earners employed of 856029. The wage earnings not only show an increased aggregate but an increase per capita from $386 in 1880 to $547 in 1890 or 41.71 per cent. The new industrial plants established since October 6 1890 and up to October 22 1892 as partially reported in the American Economist number 345 and the extension of existing plants 108; the new capital invested amounts to $40449050 and the number of additional employees to 37285. The Textile World for July 1892 states that during the first six months of the present calendar year 135 new factories were built of which 40 are cotton mills 48 knitting mills 26 woolen mills 15 silk mills 4 plush mills and 2 linen mills. Of the 40 cotton mills 21 have been built in the Southern States. Mr. A. B. Shepperson of the New York Cotton Exchange estimates the number of working spindles in the United States on September 1 1892 at 15200000 an increase of 660000 over the year 1891. The consumption of cotton by American mills in 1891 was 2396000 bales and in 1892 2584000 bales an increase of 188000 bales. From the year 1869 to 1892 inclusive there has been an increase in the consumption of cotton in Europe of 92 per cent while during the same period the increased consumption in the United States has been about 150 per cent. The report of Ira Ayer special agent of the Treasury Department shows that at the date of September 30 1892 there were 32 companies manufacturing tin and terne plate in the United States and 14 companies building new works for such manufacture. The estimated investment in buildings and plants at the close of the fiscal year June 30 1893 if existing conditions were to be continued was $5000000 and the estimated rate of production 200000000 pounds per annum. The actual production for the quarter ending September 30 1892 was 10952725 pounds. The report of Labor Commissioner Peck of New York shows that during the year 1891 in about 6000 manufacturing establishments in that State embraced within the special inquiry made by him and representing 67 different industries there was a net increase over the year 1890 of $30315130.68 in the value of the product and of $6377925.09 in the amount of wages paid. The report of the commissioner of labor for the State of Massachusetts shows that 3745 industries in that State paid $129416248 in wages during the year 1891 against $126030303 in 1890 an increase of $3335945 and that there was an increase of $9932490 in the amount of capital and of 7346 in the number of persons employed in the same period. During the last six months of the year 1891 and the first six months of 1892 the total production of pig iron was 9710819 tons as against 9202703 tons in the year 1890 which was the largest annual production ever attained. For the same twelve months of 1891-92 the production of Bessemer ingots was 3878581 tons an increase of 189710 gross tons over the previously unprecedented yearly production of 3688871 gross tons in 1890. The production of Bessemer steel rails for the first six months of 1892 was 772436 gross tons as against 702080 gross tons during the last six months of the year 1891. The total value of our foreign trade (exports and imports of merchandise) during the last fiscal year was $1857680610 an increase of $128283604 over the previous fiscal year. The average annual value of our imports and exports of merchandise for the ten fiscal years prior to 1891 was $1457322019. It will be observed that our foreign trade for 1892 exceeded this annual average value by $400358591 an increase of 27.47 per cent. The significance and value of this increase are shown by the fact that the excess in the trade of 1892 over 1891 was wholly in the value of exports for there was a decrease in the value of imports of $17513754. The value of our exports during the fiscal year 1892 reached the highest figure in the history of the Government amounting to $1030278148 exceeding by $145797338 the exports of 1891 and exceeding the value of the imports by $202875686. A comparison of the value of our exports for 1892 with the annual average for the ten years prior to 1891 shows an excess of $265142651 or of 34.65 per cent. The value of our imports of merchandise for 1892 which was $829402462 also exceeded the annual average value of the ten years prior to 1891 by $135215940. During the fiscal year 1892 the value of imports free of duty amounted to $457999658 the largest aggregate in the history of our commerce. The value of the imports of merchandise entered free of duty in 1892 was 55.35 per cent of the total value of imports as compared with 43.35 per cent in 1891 and 33.66 per cent in 1890. In our coastwise trade a most encouraging development is in progress there having been in the last four years an increase of 16 per cent. In internal commerce the statistics show that no such period of prosperity has ever before existed. The freight carried in the coastwise trade of the Great Lakes in 1890 aggregated 28295959 tons. On the Mississippi Missouri and Ohio rivers and tributaries in the same year the traffic aggregated 29405046 tons and the total vessel tonnage passing through the Detroit River during that year was 21684000 tons. The vessel tonnage entered and cleared in the foreign trade of London during 1890 amounted to 13480767 tons and of Liverpool 10941800 tons a total for these two great shipping ports of 24422568 tons only slightly in excess of the vessel tonnage passing through the Detroit River. And it should be said that the season for the Detroit River was but 228 days while of course in London and Liverpool the season was for the entire year. The vessel tonnage passing through the St. Marys Canal for the fiscal year 1892 amounted to 9828874 tons and the freight tonnage of the Detroit River is estimated for that year at 25000000 tons against 23209619 tons in 1891. The aggregate traffic on our railroads for the year 1891 amounted to 704398609 tons of freight compared with 691344437 tons in 1890 an increase of 13054172 tons. Another indication of the general prosperity of the country is found in the fact that the number of depositors in savings banks increased from 693870 in 1860 to 4258893 in 1890 an increase of 513 per cent and the amount of deposits from $149277504 in 1860 to $1524844506 in 1890 an increase of 921 per cent. In 1891 the amount of deposits in savings banks was $1623079749. It is estimated that 90 per cent of these deposits represent the savings of wage earners. The bank clearances for nine months ending September 30 1891 amounted to $4104939008. For the same months in 1892 they amounted to $45189601947 an excess for the nine months of $4140211139. There never has been a time in our history when work was so abundant or when wages were as high whether measured by the currency in which they are paid or by their power to supply the necessaries and comforts of life. It is true that the market prices of cotton and wheat have been low. It is one of the unfavorable incidents of agriculture that the farmer can not produce upon orders. He must sow and reap in ignorance of the aggregate production of the year and is peculiarly subject to the depreciation which follows overproduction. But while the fact I have stated is true as to the crops mentioned the general average of prices has been such as to give to agriculture a fair participation in the general prosperity. The value of our total farm products has increased from $1363646866 in 1860 to $4500000000 in 1891 as estimated by statisticians an increase of 230 per cent. The number of hogs January 1 1891 was 50625106 and their value $210193925; on January 1 1892 the number was 52398019 and the value $241031415. On January 1 1891 the number of cattle was 36875648 and the value $544127908; on January 1 1892 the number was 37651239 and the value $570749155. If any are discontented with their state here if any believe that wages or prices the returns for honest toil are inadequate they should not fail to remember that there is no other country in the world where the conditions that seem to them hard would not be accepted as highly prosperous. The English agriculturist would be glad to exchange the returns of his labor for those of the American farmer and the Manchester workmen their wages for those of their fellows at Fall River. I believe that the protective system which has now for something more than thirty years continuously prevailed in our legislation has been a mighty instrument for the development of our national wealth and a most powerful agency in protecting the homes of our workingmen from the invasion of want. I have felt a most solicitous interest to preserve to our working people rates of wages that would not only give daily bread but supply a comfortable margin for those home attractions and family comforts and enjoyments without which life is neither hopeful nor sweet. They are American citizens--a part of the great people for whom our Constitution and Government were framed and instituted--and it can not be a perversion of that Constitution to so legislate as to preserve in their homes the comfort independence loyalty and sense of interest in the Government which are essential to good citizenship in peace and which will bring this stalwart throng as in 1861 to the defense of the flag when it is assailed. It is not my purpose to renew here the argument in favor of a protective tariff. The result of the recent election must be accepted as having introduced a new policy. We must assume that the present tariff constructed upon the lines of protection is to be repealed and that there is to be substituted for it a tariff law constructed solely with reference to revenue; that no duty is to be higher because the increase will keep open an American mill or keep up the wages of an American workman but that in every case such a rate of duty is to be imposed as will bring to the Treasury of the United States the largest returns of revenue. The contention has not been between schedules but between principles and it would be offensive to suggest that the prevailing party will not carry into legislation the principles advocated by it and the pledges given to the people. The tariff bills passed by the House of Representatives at the last session were as I suppose even in the opinion of their promoters inadequate and justified only by the fact that the Senate and House of Representatives were not in accord and that a general revision could not therefore be undertaken. I recommend that the whole subject of tariff revision be left to the incoming Congress. It is matter of regret that this work must be delayed for at least three months for the threat of great tariff changes introduces so much uncertainty that an amount not easily estimated of business inaction and of diminished production will necessarily result. It is possible also that this uncertainty may result in decreased revenues from customs duties for our merchants will make cautious orders for foreign goods in view of the prospect of tariff reductions and the uncertainty as to when they will take effect. Those who have advocated a protective tariff can well afford to have their disastrous forecasts of a change of policy disappointed. If a system of customs duties can be framed that will set the idle wheels and looms of Europe in motion and crowd our warehouses with foreign-made goods and at the same time keep our own mills busy; that will give us an increased participation in the "markets of the world" of greater value than the home market we surrender; that will give increased work to foreign workmen upon products to be consumed by our people without diminishing the amount of work to be done here; that will enable the American manufacturer to pay to his workmen from 50 to 100 per cent more in wages than is paid in the foreign mill and yet to compete in our market and in foreign markets with the foreign producer; that will further reduce the cost of articles of wear and food without reducing the wages of those who produce them; that can be celebrated after its effects have been realized as its expectation has been in European as well as in American cities the authors and promoters of it will be entitled to the highest praise. We have had in our history several experiences of the contrasted effects of a revenue and of a protective tariff but this generation has not felt them and the experience of one generation is not highly instructive to the next. The friends of the protective system with undiminished confidence in the principles they have advocated will await the results of the new experiment. The strained and too often disturbed relations existing between the employees and the employers in our great manufacturing establishments have not been favorable to a calm consideration by the wage earner of the effect upon wages of the protective system. The facts that his wages were the highest paid in like callings in the world and that a maintenance of this rate of wages in the absence of protective duties upon the product of his labor was impossible were obscured by the passion evoked by these contests. He may now be able to review the question in the light of his personal experience under the operation of a tariff for revenue only. If that experience shall demonstrate that present rates of wages are thereby maintained or increased either absolutely or in their purchasing power and that the aggregate volume of work to be done in this country is increased or even maintained so that there are more or as many days' work in a year at as good or better wages for the American workmen as has been the case under the protective system everyone will rejoice. A general process of wage reduction can not be contemplated by any patriotic citizen without the gravest apprehension. It may be indeed I believe is possible for the American manufacturer to compete successfully with his foreign rival in many branches of production without the defense of protective duties if the pay rolls are equalized; but the conflict that stands between the producer and that result and the distress of our working people when it is attained are not pleasant to contemplate. The Society of the Unemployed now holding its frequent and threatening parades in the streets of foreign cities should not be allowed to acquire an American domicile. The reports of the heads of the several Executive Departments which are herewith submitted have very naturally included a resume of the whole work of the Administration with the transactions of the last fiscal year. The attention not only of Congress but of the country is again invited to the methods of administration which have been pursued and to the results which have been attained. Public revenues amounting to $1414079292.28 have been collected and disbursed without loss from misappropriation without a single defalcation of such importance as to attract the public attention and at a diminished per cent of cost for collection. The public business has been transacted not only with fidelity but progressively and with a view to giving to the people in the fullest possible degree the benefits of a service established and maintained for their protection and comfort. Our relations with other nations are now undisturbed by any serious controversy. The complicated and threatening differences with Germany and England relating to Samoan affairs with England in relation to the seal fisheries in the Bering Sea and with Chile growing out of the Baltimore affair have been adjusted. There have been negotiated and concluded under section 3 of the tariff law commercial agreements relating to reciprocal trade with the following countries: Brazil Dominican Republic Spain for Cuba and Puerto Rico Guatemala Salvador the German Empire Great Britain for certain West Indian colonies and British Guiana Nicaragua Honduras and Austria-Hungary. Of these those with Guatemala Salvador the German Empire Great Britain Nicaragua Honduras and Austria-Hungary have been concluded since my last annual message. Under these trade arrangements a free or favored admission has been secured in every case for an important list of American products. Especial care has been taken to secure markets for farm products in order to relieve that great underlying industry of the depression which the lack of an adequate foreign market for our surplus often brings. An opening has also been made for manufactured products that will undoubtedly if this policy is maintained greatly augment our export trade. The full benefits of these arrangements can not be realized instantly. New lines of trade are to be opened. The commercial traveler must survey the field. The manufacturer must adapt his goods to the new markets and facilities for exchange must be established. This work has been well begun our merchants and manufacturers having entered the new fields with courage and enterprise. In the case of food products and especially with Cuba the trade did not need to wait and the immediate results have been most gratifying. If this policy and these trade arrangements can be continued in force and aided by the establishment of American steamship lines I do not doubt that we shall within a short period secure fully one-third of the total trade of the countries of Central and South America which now amounts to about $600000000 annually. In 1885 we had only 8 per cent of this trade. The following statistics show the increase in our trade with the countries with which we have reciprocal trade agreements from the date when such agreements went into effect up to September 30 1892 the increase being in some almost wholly and in others in an important degree the result of these agreements: The domestic exports to Germany and Austria-Hungary have increased in value from $47673756 to $57993064 an increase of $10319308 or 21.63 per cent. With American countries the value of our exports has increased from $44160285 to $54613598 an increase of $10453313 or 23.67 per cent. The total increase in the value of exports to all the countries with which we have reciprocity agreements has been $20772621. This increase is chiefly in wheat flour meat and dairy products and in manufactures of iron and steel and lumber. There has been a large increase in the value of imports from all these countries since the commercial agreements went into effect amounting to $74294525 but it has been entirely in imports from the American countries consisting mostly of sugar coffee india rubber and crude drugs. The alarmed attention of our European competitors for the South American market has been attracted to this new American policy and to our acquisition and their loss of South American trade. A treaty providing for the arbitration of the dispute between Great Britain and the United States as to the killing of seals in the Bering Sea was concluded on the 29th of February last. This treaty was accompanied by an agreement prohibiting pelagic sealing pending the arbitration and a vigorous effort was made during this season to drive out all poaching sealers from the Bering Sea. Six naval vessels three revenue cutters and one vessel from the Fish Commission all under the command of Commander Evans of the Navy were sent into the sea which was systematically patrolled. Some seizures were made and it is believed that the catch in the Bering Sea by poachers amounted to less than 500 seals. It is true however that in the North Pacific while the seal herds were on their way to the passes between the Aleutian Islands a very large number probably 35000 were taken. The existing statutes of the United States do not restrain our citizens from taking seals in the Pacific Ocean and perhaps should not unless the prohibition can be extended to the citizens of other nations. I recommend that power be given to the President by proclamation to prohibit the taking of seals in the North Pacific by American vessels in case either as the result of the findings of the Tribunal of Arbitration or otherwise the restraints can be applied to the vessels of all countries. The case of the United States for the Tribunal of Arbitration has been prepared with great care and industry by the Hon. John W. Foster and the counsel who represent this Government express confidence that a result substantially establishing our claims and preserving this great industry for the benefit of all nations will be attained. During the past year a suggestion was received through the British minister that the Canadian government would like to confer as to the possibility of enlarging upon terms of mutual advantage the commercial exchanges of Canada and of the United States and a conference was held at Washington with Mr. Blaine acting for this Government and the British minister at this capital and three members of the Dominion cabinet acting as commissioners on the part of Great Britain. The conference developed the fact that the Canadian government was only prepared to offer to the United States in exchange for the concessions asked the admission of natural products. The statement was frankly made that favored rates could not be given to the United States as against the mother country. This admission which was foreseen necessarily terminated the conference upon this question. The benefits of an exchange of natural products would be almost wholly with the people of Canada. Some other topics of interest were considered in the conference and have resulted in the making of a convention for examining the Alaskan boundary and the waters of Passamaquoddy Bay adjacent to Eastport Me. and in the initiation of an arrangement for the protection of fish life in the coterminous and neighboring waters of our northern border. The controversy as to tolls upon the Welland Canal which was presented to Congress at the last session by special message having failed of adjustment I felt constrained to exercise the authority conferred by the act of July 26 1892 and to proclaim a suspension of the free use of St. Marys Falls Canal to cargoes in transit to ports in Canada. The Secretary of the Treasury established such tolls as were thought to be equivalent to the exactions unjustly levied upon our commerce in the Canadian canals. If as we must suppose the political relations of Canada and the disposition of the Canadian government are to remain unchanged a somewhat radical revision of our trade relations should I think be made. Our relations must continue to be intimate and they should be friendly. I regret to say however that in many of the controversies notably those as to the fisheries on the Atlantic the sealing interests on the Pacific and the canal tolls our negotiations with Great Britain have continuously been thwarted or retarded by unreasonable and unfriendly objections and protests from Canada in the matter of the canal tolls our treaty rights were flagrantly disregarded. It is hardly too much to say that the Canadian Pacific and other railway lines which parallel our northern boundary are sustained by commerce having either its origin or terminus or both in the United States. Canadian railroads compete with those of the United States for our traffic and without the restraints of our interstate-commerce act. Their cars pass almost without detention into and out of our territory. The Canadian Pacific Railway brought into the United States from China and Japan via British Columbia during the year ended June 30 1892 23239689 pounds of freight and it carried from the United States to be shipped to China and Japan via British Columbia 24068346 pounds of freight. There were also shipped from the United States over this road from Eastern ports of the United States to our Pacific ports during the same year 13912073 pounds of freight and there were received over this road at the United States Eastern ports from ports on the Pacific Coast 13293315 pounds of freight. Mr. Joseph Nimmo jr. former chief of the Bureau of Statistics when before the Senate Select Committee on Relations with Canada April 26 1890 said that "the value of goods thus transported between different points in the United States across Canadian territory probably amounts to $100000000 a year." There is no disposition on the part of the people or Government of the United States to interfere in the smallest degree with the political relations of Canada. That question is wholly with her own people. It is time for us however to consider whether if the present state of things and trend of things is to continue our interchanges upon lines of land transportation should not be put upon a different basis and our entire independence of Canadian canals and of the St. Lawrence as an outlet to the sea secured by the construction of an American canal around the Falls of Niagara and the opening of ship communication between the Great Lakes and one of our own seaports. We should not hesitate to avail ourselves of our great natural trade advantages. We should withdraw the support which is given to the railroads and steamship lines of Canada by a traffic that properly belongs to us and no longer furnish the earnings which lighten the otherwise crushing weight of the enormous public subsidies that have been given to them. The subject of the power of the Treasury to deal with this matter without further legislation has been under consideration but circumstances have postponed a conclusion. It is probable that a consideration of the propriety of a modification or abrogation of the article of the treaty of Washington relating to the transit of goods in bond is involved in any complete solution of the question. Congress at the last session was kept advised of the progress of the serious and for a time threatening difference between the United States and Chile. It gives me now great gratification to report that the Chilean Government in a most friendly and honorable spirit has tendered and paid as an indemnity to the families of the sailors of the Baltimore who were killed and to those who were injured in the outbreak in the city of Valparaiso the sum of $75000. This has been accepted not only as an indemnity for a wrong done but as a most gratifying evidence that the Government of Chile rightly appreciates the disposition of this Government to act in a spirit of the most absolute fairness and friendliness in our intercourse with that brave people. A further and conclusive evidence of the mutual respect and confidence now existing is furnished by the fact that a convention submitting to arbitration the mutual claims of the citizens of the respective Governments has been agreed upon. Some of these claims have been pending for many years and have been the occasion of much unsatisfactory diplomatic correspondence. I have endeavored in every way to assure our sister Republics of Central and South America that the United States Government and its people have only the most friendly disposition toward them all. We do not covet their territory. We have no disposition to be oppressive or exacting in our dealings with any of them even the weakest. Our interests and our hopes for them all lie in the direction of stable governments by their people and of the largest development of their great commercial resources. The mutual benefits of enlarged commercial exchanges and of a more familiar and friendly intercourse between our peoples we do desire and in this have sought their friendly cooperation. I have believed however while holding these sentiments in the greatest sincerity that we must insist upon a just responsibility for any injuries inflicted upon our official representatives or upon our citizens. This insistence kindly and justly but firmly made will I believe promote peace and mutual respect. Our relations with Hawaii have been such as to attract an increased interest and must continue to do so. I deem it of great importance that the projected submarine cable a survey for which has been made should be promoted. Both for naval and commercial uses we should have quick communication with Honolulu. We should before this have availed ourselves of the concession made many years ago to this Government for a harbor and naval station at Pearl River. Many evidences of the friendliness of the Hawaiian Government have been given in the past and it is gratifying to believe that the advantage and necessity of a continuance of very close relations is appreciated. The friendly act of this Government in expressing to the Government of Italy its reprobation and abhorrence of the lynching of Italian subjects in New Orleans by the payment of 125000 francs or $24330.90 was accepted by the King of Italy with every manifestation of gracious appreciation and the incident has been highly promotive of mutual respect and good will. In consequence of the action of the French Government in proclaiming a protectorate over certain tribal districts of the west coast of Africa eastward of the San Pedro River which has long been regarded as the southeastern boundary of Liberia I have felt constrained to make protest against this encroachment upon the territory of a Republic which was rounded by citizens of the United States and toward which this country has for many years held the intimate relation of a friendly counselor. The recent disturbances of the public peace by lawless foreign marauders on the Mexican frontier have afforded this Government an opportunity to testify its good will for Mexico and its earnest purpose to fulfill the obligations of international friendship by pursuing and dispersing the evil doers. The work of relocating the boundary of the treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo westward from El Paso is progressing favorably. Our intercourse with Spain continues on a friendly footing. I regret however not to be able to report as yet the adjustment of the claims of the American missionaries arising from the disorders at Ponape in the Caroline Islands but I anticipate a satisfactory adjustment in view of renewed and urgent representations to the Government at Madrid. The treatment of the religious and educational establishments of American citizens in Turkey has of late called for a more than usual share of attention. A tendency to curtail the toleration which has so beneficially prevailed is discernible and has called forth the earnest remonstrance of this Government. Harassing regulations in regard to schools and churches have been attempted in certain localities but not without due protest and the assertion of the inherent and conventional rights of our countrymen. Violations of domicile and search of the persons and effects of citizens of the United States by apparently irresponsible officials in the Asiatic vilayets have from time to time been reported. An aggravated instance of injury
