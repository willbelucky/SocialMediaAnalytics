Mr President Mr Speaker members of the 104th Congress my fellow Americans Again we are here in the sanctuary of democracy and once again our democracy has spoken So let me begin by congratulating all of you here in the 104th Congress and congratulating you Mr Speaker If we agree on nothing else tonight we must agree that the American people certainly voted for change in 1992 and in 1994 And as I look out at you I know how some of you must have felt in 1992 I must say that in both years we didn t hear America singing we heard America shouting And now all of us Republicans and Democrats alike must say We hear you We will work together to earn the jobs you have given us For we are the keepers of a sacred trust and we must be faithful to it in this new and very demanding era Over 200 years ago our Founders changed the entire course of human history by joining together to create a new country based on a single powerful idea We hold these truths to be self evident that all men are created equal endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights and among these are Life Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness It has fallen to every generation since then to preserve that idea the American idea and to deepen and expand its meaning in new and different times to Lincoln and to his Congress to preserve the Union and to end slavery to Theodore Roosevelt and Woodrow Wilson to restrain the abuses and excesses of the industrial revolution and to assert our leadership in the world to Franklin Roosevelt to fight the failure and pain of the Great Depression and to win our country s great struggle against fascism and to all our Presidents since to fight the Cold War Especially I recall two who struggled to fight that Cold War in partnership with Congresses where the majority was of a different party to Harry Truman who summoned us to unparalleled prosperity at home and who built the architecture of the Cold War and to Ronald Reagan whom we wish well tonight and who exhorted us to carry on until the twilight struggle against Communism was won In another time of change and challenge I had the honor to be the first President to be elected in the post Cold War era an era marked by the global economy the information revolution unparalleled change and opportunity and insecurity for the American people I came to this hallowed chamber two years ago on a mission to restore the American dream for all our people and to make sure that we move into the 21st century still the strongest force for freedom and democracy in the entire world I was determined then to tackle the tough problems too long ignored In this effort I am frank to say that I have made my mistakes and I have learned again the importance of humility in all human endeavor But I am also proud to say tonight that our country is stronger than it was two years ago Applause Thank you Record numbers of Americans are succeeding in the new global economy We are at peace and we are a force for peace and freedom throughout the world We have almost six million new jobs since I became President and we have the lowest combined rate of unemployment and inflation in 25 years Our businesses are more productive And here we have worked to bring the deficit down to expand trade to put more police on our streets to give our citizens more of the tools they need to get an education and to rebuild their own communities But the rising tide is not lifting all boats While our nation is enjoying peace and prosperity too many of our people are still working harder and harder for less and less While our businesses are restructuring and growing more productive and competitive too many of our people still can t be sure of having a job next year or even next month And far more than our material riches are threatened things far more precious to us our children our families our values Our civil life is suffering in America today Citizens are working together less and shouting at each other more The common bonds of community which have been the great strength of our country from its very beginning are badly frayed What are we to do about it More than 60 years ago at the dawn of another new era President Roosevelt told our nation New conditions impose new requirements on government and those who conduct government And from that simple proposition he shaped the New Deal which helped to restore our Nation to prosperity and define the relationship between our people and their government for half a century That approach worked in its time But we today we face a very different time and very different conditions We are moving from an industrial age built on gears and sweat to an information age demanding skills and learning and flexibility Our government once a champion of national purpose is now seen by many as simply a captive of narrow interests putting more burdens on our citizens rather than equipping them to get ahead The values that used to hold us all together seem to be coming apart So tonight we must forge a new social compact to meet the challenges of this time As we enter a new era we need a new set of understandings not just with government but even more important with one another as Americans That s what I want to talk with you about tonight I call it the New Covenant But it s grounded in a very very old idea that all Americans have not just a right but a solemn responsibility to rise as far as their God given talents and determination can take them and to give something back to their communities and their country in return Opportunity and responsibility They go hand in hand We can t have one without the other And our national community can t hold together without both Our New Covenant is a new set of understandings for how we can equip our people to meet the challenges of a new economy how we can change the way our government works to fit a different time and above all how we can repair the damaged bonds in our society and come together behind our common purpose We must have dramatic change in our economy our government and ourselves My fellow Americans without regard to party let us rise to the occasion Let us put aside partisanship and pettiness and pride As we embark on this new course let us put our country first remembering that regardless of party label we are all Americans And let the final test of everything we do be a simple one Is it good for the American people Let me begin by saying that we cannot ask Americans to be better citizens if we are not better servants You made a good start by passing that law which applies to Congress all the laws you put on the private sector and I was proud to sign it yesterday But we have a lot more to do before people really trust the way things work around here Three times as many lobbyists are in the streets and corridors of Washington as were here 20 years ago The American people look at their capital and they see a city where the well connected and the well protected can work the system but the interests of ordinary citizens are often left out As the new Congress opened its doors lobbyists were still doing business as usual the gifts the trips all the things that people are concerned about haven t stopped Twice this month you missed opportunities to stop these practices I know there were other considerations in those votes but I want to use something that I ve heard my Republican friends say from time to time There doesn t have to be a law for everything So tonight I ask you to just stop taking the lobbyists perks Just stop We don t have to wait for legislation to pass to send a strong signal to the American people that things are really changing But I also hope you will send me the strongest possible lobby reform bill and I ll sign that too We should require lobbyists to tell the people for whom they work what they re spending what they want We should also curb the role of big money in elections by capping the cost of campaigns and limiting the influence of PACs And as I have said for three years we should work to open the airwaves so that they can be an instrument of democracy not a weapon of destruction by giving free TV time to candidates for public office When the last Congress killed political reform last year it was reported in the press that the lobbyists actually stood in the halls of this sacred building and cheered This year let s give the folks at home something to cheer about More important I think we all agree that we have to change the way the government works Let s make it smaller less costly and smarter leaner not meaner Applause I just told the Speaker the equal time doctrine is alive and well Laughter The New Covenant approach to governing is as different from the old bureaucratic way as the computer is from the manual typewriter The old way of governing around here protected organized interests We should look out for the interests of ordinary people The old way divided us by interest constituency or class The New Covenant way should unite us behind a common vision of what s best for our country The old way dispensed services through large top down inflexible bureaucracies The New Covenant way should shift these resources and decisionmaking from bureaucrats to citizens injecting choice and competition and individual responsibility into national policy The old way of governing around here actually seemed to reward failure The New Covenant way should have built in incentives to reward success The old way was centralized here in Washington The New Covenant way must take hold in the communities all across America And we should help them to do that Our job here is to expand opportunity not bureaucracy to empower people to make the most of their own lives and to enhance our security here at home and abroad We must not ask government to do what we should do for ourselves We should rely on government as a partner to help us to do more for ourselves and for each other I hope very much that as we debate these specific and exciting matters we can go beyond the sterile discussion between the illusion that there is somehow a program for every problem on the one hand and the other illusion that the government is a source of every problem we have Our job is to get rid of yesterday s government so that our own people can meet today s and tomorrow s needs And we ought to do it together You know for years before I became President I heard others say they would cut government and how bad it was but not much happened We actually did it We cut over a quarter of a trillion dollars in spending more than 300 domestic programs more than 100000 positions from the federal bureaucracy in the last two years alone Based on decisions already made we will have cut a total of more than a quarter of a million positions from the federal government making it the smallest it has been since John Kennedy was President by the time I come here again next year Under the leadership of Vice President Gore our initiatives have already saved taxpayers 63 billion The age of the 500 hammer and the ashtray you can break on David Letterman is gone Deadwood programs like mohair subsidies are gone We ve streamlined the Agriculture Department by reducing it by more than 1200 offices We ve slashed the small business loan form from an inch thick to a single page We ve thrown away the government s 10000 page personnel manual And the government is working better in important ways FEMA the Federal Emergency Management Agency has gone from being a disaster to helping people in disasters You can ask the farmers in the Middle West who fought the flood there or the people in California who have dealt with floods and earthquakes and fires and they ll tell you that Government workers working hand in hand with private business rebuilt Southern California s fractured freeways in record time and under budget And because the federal government moved fast all but one of the 5600 schools damaged in the earthquake are back in business Now there are a lot of other things that I could talk about I want to just mention one because it will be discussed here in the next few weeks University administrators all over the country have told me that they are saving weeks and weeks of bureaucratic time now because of our direct college loan program which makes college loans cheaper and more affordable with better repayment terms for students costs the government less and cuts out paperwork and bureaucracy for the government and for the universities We shouldn t cap that program We should give every college in America the opportunity to be a part of it Previous government programs gathered dust The Reinventing Government report is getting results And we re not through There s going to be a second round of Reinventing Government We propose to cut 130 billion in spending by shrinking departments extending our freeze on domestic spending cutting 60 public housing programs down to three getting rid of over 100 programs we do not need like the Interstate Commerce Commission and the Helium Reserve Program And we re working on getting rid of unnecessary regulations and making them more sensible The programs and regulations that have outlived their usefulness should go We have to cut yesterday s government to help solve tomorrow s problems And we need to get government closer to the people it s meant to serve We need to help move programs down to the point where states and communities and private citizens in the private sector can do a better job If they can do it we ought to let them do it We should get out of the way and let them do what they can do better Taking power away from federal bureaucracies and giving it back to communities and individuals is something everyone should be able to be for It s time for Congress to stop passing on to the states the cost of decisions we make here in Washington I know there are still serious differences over the details of the unfunded mandates legislation but I want to work with you to make sure we pass a reasonable bill which will protect the national interests and give justified relief where we need to give it For years Congress concealed in the budget scores of pet spending projects Last year was no difference There was a 1 million to study stress in plants and 12 million for a tick removal program that didn t work It s hard to remove ticks Those of us who have had them know Laughter But I ll tell you something if you ll give me line item veto I ll remove some of that unnecessary spending But I think we should all remember and almost all of us would agree that government still has important responsibilities Our young people we should think of this when we cut our young people hold our future in their hands We still owe a debt to our veterans And our senior citizens have made us what we are Now my budget cuts a lot But it protects education veterans Social Security and Medicare and I hope you will do the same thing You should and I hope you will And when we give more flexibility to the states let us remember that there are certain fundamental national needs that should be addressed in every state North and South East and West Immunization against childhood disease school lunches in all our schools Head Start medical care and nutrition for pregnant women and infants applause medical care and nutrition for pregnant women and infants all these things all these things are in the national interest I applaud your desire to get rid of costly and unnecessary regulations But when we deregulate let s remember what national action in the national interest has given us safer food for our families safer toys for our children safer nursing homes for our parents safer cars and highways and safer workplaces cleaner air and cleaner water Do we need common sense and fairness in our regulations You bet we do But we can have common sense and still provide for safe drinking water We can have fairness and still clean up toxic dumps and we ought to do it Should we cut the deficit more Well of course we should Of course we should But we can bring it down in a way that still protects our economic recovery and does not unduly punish people who should not be punished but instead should be helped I know many of you in this chamber support the balanced budget amendment I certainly want to balance the budget Our administration has done more to bring the budget down and to save money than any in a very very long time If you believe passing this amendment is the right thing to do then you have to be straight with the American people They have a right to know what you re going to cut what taxes you re going to raise and how it s going to affect them We should be doing things in the open around here For example everybody ought to know if this proposal is going to endanger Social Security I would oppose that and I think most Americans would Nothing has done more to undermine our sense of common responsibility than our failed welfare system This is one of the problems we have to face here in Washington in our New Covenant It rewards welfare over work It undermines family values It lets millions of parents get away without paying their child support It keeps a minority but a significant minority of the people on welfare trapped on it for a very long time I ve worked on this problem for a long time nearly 15 years now As a Governor I had the honor of working with the Reagan administration to write the last welfare reform bill back in 1988 In the last two years we made a good start at continuing the work of welfare reform Our administration gave two dozen states the right to slash through federal rules and regulations to reform their own welfare systems and to try to promote work and responsibility over welfare and dependency Last year I introduced the most sweeping welfare reform plan ever presented by an administration We have to make welfare what it was meant to be a second chance not a way of life We have to help those on welfare move to work as quickly as possible to provide child care and teach them skills if that s what they need for up to two years And after that there ought to be a simple hard rule Anyone who can work must go to work If a parent isn t paying child support they should be forced to pay We should suspend drivers license track them across state lines make them work off what they owe That is what we should do governments do not raise children people do And the parents must take responsibility for the children they bring into this world I want to work with you with all of you to pass welfare reform But our goal must be to liberate people and lift them up from dependence to independence from welfare to work from mere childbearing to responsible parenting Our goal should not be to punish them because they happen to be poor We should we should require work and mutual responsibility But we shouldn t cut people off just because they re poor they re young or even because they re unmarried We should promote responsibility by requiring young mothers to live at home with their parents or in other supervised settings by requiring them to finish school But we shouldn t put them and their children out on the street And I know all the arguments pro and con and I have read and thought about this for a long time I still don t think we can in good conscience punish poor children for the mistakes of their parents My fellow Americans every single survey shows that all the American people care about this without regard to party or race or region So let this be the year we end welfare as we know it But also let this be the year that we are all able to stop using this issue to divide America No one is more eager to end welfare applause I may be the only President who has actually had the opportunity to sit in a welfare office who s actually spent hours and hours talking to people on welfare And I am telling you the people who are trapped on it know it doesn t work they also want to get off So we can promote together education and work and good parenting I have no problem with punishing bad behavior or the refusal to be a worker or a student or a responsible parent I just don t want to punish poverty and past mistakes All of us have made our mistakes and none of us can change our yesterdays But every one of us can change our tomorrows And America s best example of that may be Lynn Woolsey who worked her way off welfare to become a Congresswoman from the State of California I know the members of this Congress are concerned about crime as are all the citizens of our country And I remind you that last year we passed a very tough crime bill longer sentences three strikes and you re out almost 60 new capital punishment offenses more prisons more prevention 100000 more police And we paid for it all by reducing the size of the federal bureaucracy and giving the money back to local communities to lower the crime rate There may be other things we can do to be tougher on crime to be smarter with crime to help to lower that rate first Well if there are let s talk about them and let s do them But let s not go back on the things that we did last year that we know work that we know work because the local law enforcement officers tell us that we did the right thing because local community leaders who have worked for years and years to lower the crime rate tell us that they work Let s look at the experience of our cities and our rural areas where the crime rate has gone down and ask the people who did it how they did it And if what we did last year supports the decline in the crime rate and I am convinced that it does let us not go back on it Let s stick with it implement it We ve got four more hard years of work to do to do that I don t want to destroy the good atmosphere in the room or in the country tonight but I have to mention one issue that divided this body greatly last year The last Congress also passed the Brady bill and in the crime bill the ban on 19 assault weapons I don t think it s a secret to anybody in this room that several members of the last Congress who voted for that aren t here tonight because they voted for it And I know therefore that some of you who are here because they voted for it are under enormous pressure to repeal it I just have to tell you how I feel about it The members of Congress who voted for that bill and I would never do anything to infringe on the right to keep and bear arms to hunt and to engage in other appropriate sporting activities I ve done it since I was a boy and I m going to keep right on doing it until I can t do it anymore But a lot of people laid down their seats in Congress so that police officers and kids wouldn t have to lay down their lives under a hail of assault weapon attack and I will not let that be repealed I will not let it be repealed I d like to talk about a couple of other issues we have to deal with I want us to cut more spending but I hope we won t cut government programs that help to prepare us for the new economy promote responsibility and are organized from the grassroots up not by gederal bureaucracy The very best example of this is the national service corps AmeriCorps It passed with strong bipartisan support And now there are 20000 Americans more than ever served in one year in the Peace Corps working all over this country helping people person to person in local grassroots volunteer groups solving problems and in the process earning some money for their education This is citizenship at its best It s good for the AmeriCorps members but it s good for the rest of us too It s the essence of the New Covenant and we shouldn t stop it All Americans not only in the states most heavily affected but in every place in this country are rightly disturbed by the large numbers of illegal aliens entering our country The jobs they hold might otherwise be held by citizens or legal immigrants The public service they use impose burdens on our taxpayers That s why our administration has moved aggressively to secure our borders more by hiring a record number of new border guards by deporting twice as many criminal aliens as ever before by cracking down on illegal hiring by barring welfare benefits to illegal aliens In the budget I will present to you we will try to do more to speed the deportation of illegal aliens who are arrested for crimes to better identify illegal aliens in the workplace as recommended by the commission headed by former Congresswoman Barbara Jordan We are a nation of immigrants But we are also a nation of laws It is wrong and ultimately self defeating for a nation of immigrants to permit the kind of abuse of our immigration laws we have seen in recent years and we must do more to stop it The most important job of our government in this new era is to empower the American people to succeed in the global economy America has always been a land of opportunity a land where if you work hard you can get ahead We ve become a great middle class country Middle class values sustain us We must expand that middle class and shrink the underclass even as we do everything we can to support the millions of Americans who are already successful in the new economy America is once again the world s strongest economic power almost six million new jobs in the last two years exports booming inflation down High wage jobs are coming back A record number of American entrepreneurs are living the American dream If we want it to stay that way those who work and lift our nation must have more of its benefits Today too many of those people are being left out They re working harder for less They have less security less income less certainty that they can even afford a vacation much less college for their kids or retirement for themselves We cannot let this continue If we don t act our economy will probably keep doing what it s been doing since about 1978 when the income growth began to go to those at the very top of our economic scale and the people in the vast middle got very little growth and people who worked like crazy but were on the bottom then fell even further and further behind in the years afterward no matter how hard they worked We ve got to have a government that can be a real partner in making this new economy work for all of our people a government that helps each and every one of us to get an education and to have the opportunity to renew our skills That s why we worked so hard to increase educational opportunities in the last two years from Head Start to public schools to apprenticeships for young people who don t go to college to making college loans more available and more affordable That s the first thing we have to do We ve got to do something to empower people to improve their skills The second thing we ought to do is to help people raise their incomes immediately by lowering their taxes We took the first step in 1993 with a working family tax cut for 15 million families with incomes under 27000 a tax cut that this year will average about 1000 a family And we also gave tax reductions to most small and new businesses Before we could do more than that we first had to bring down the deficit we inherited and we had to get economic growth up Now we ve done both And now we can cut taxes in a more comprehensive way But tax cuts should reinforce and promote our first obligation to empower our citizens through education and training to make the most of their own lives The spotlight should shine on those who make the right choices for themselves their families and their communities I have proposed the middle class bill of rights which should properly be called the bill of rights and responsibilities because its provisions only benefit those who are working to educate and raise their children and to educate themselves It will therefore give needed tax relief and raise incomes in both the short run and the long run in a way that benefits all of us There are four provisions First a tax deduction for all education and training after high school If you think about it we permit businesses to deduct their investment we permit individuals to deduct interest on their home mortgages but today an education is even more important to the economic well being of our whole country than even those things are We should do everything we can to encourage it And I hope you will support it Second we ought to cut taxes 500 for families with children under 13 Third we ought to foster more savings and personal responsibility by permitting people to establish an individual retirement account and withdraw from it tax free for the cost of education health care first time homebuying or the care of a parent And fourth we should pass a GI bill for America s workers We propose to collapse nearly 70 federal programs and not give the money to the states but give the money directly to the American people offer vouchers to them so that they if they re laid off or if they re working for a very low wage can get a voucher worth 2600 a year for up to two years to go to their local community colleges or wherever else they want to get the skills they need to improve their lives Let s empower people in this way move it from the government directly to the workers of America Now any one of us can call for a tax cut but I won t accept one that explodes the deficit or puts our recovery at risk We ought to pay for our tax cuts fully and honestly Just two years ago it was an open question whether we would find the strength to cut the deficit Thanks to the courage of the people who were here then many of whom didn t return we did cut the deficit We began to do what others said would not be done We cut the deficit by over 600 billion about 10000 for every family in this country It s coming down three years in a row for the first time since Mr Truman was President and I don t think anybody in America wants us to let it explode again In the budget I will send you the middle class bill of rights is fully paid for by budget cuts in bureaucracy cuts in programs cuts in special interest subsidies And the spending cuts will more than double the tax cuts My budget pays for the middle class bill of rights without any cuts in Medicare And I will oppose any attempts to pay for tax cuts with Medicare cuts That s not the right thing to do I know that a lot of you have your own ideas about tax relief and some of them I find quite interesting I really want to work with all of you My test for our proposals will be Will it create jobs and raise incomes will it strengthen our families and support our children is it paid for will it build the middle class and shrink the underclass If it does I ll support it But if it doesn t I won t The goal of building the middle class and shrinking the underclass is also why I believe that you should raise the minimum wage It rewards work Two and a half million Americans two and a half million Americans often women with children are working out there today for 4 25 an hour In terms of real buying power by next year that minimum wage will be at a 40 year low That s not my idea of how the new economy ought to work Now I ve studied the arguments and the evidence for and against a minimum wage increase I believe the weight of the evidence is that a modest increase does not cost jobs and may even lure people back into the job market But the most important thing is you can t make a living on 4 25 an hour especially if you have children even with the working families tax cut we passed last year In the past the minimum wage has been a bipartisan issue and I think it should be again So I want to challenge you to have honest hearings on this to get together to find a way to make the minimum wage a living wage Members of Congress have been here less than a month but by the end of the week 28 days into the new year every member of Congress will have earned as much in congressional salary as a minimum wage worker makes all year long Everybody else here including the President has something else that too many Americans do without and that s health care Now last year we almost came to blows over health care but we didn t do anything And the cold hard fact is that since last year since I was here another 1 1 million Americans in working families have lost their health care And the cold hard fact is that many millions more most of them farmers and small business people and self employed
